what is javascropt 
JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images,
and pretty much everything else.
A scripting language is a programming language designed for integrating and communicating with other programming languages.
programming language that executes tasks within a special run-time environment(js engine) by an interpreter instead of a compiler do not
require the compilation step

there are two way to add js in code 
head of html 
down of body html code 

variable name in js follow camelcase like firstcharacter of variableare small letter and  other start with capital letter 
ex : firstName 
data type 
primitive typr : string number boolean undefine null 
reference type : object array function 

Equality operator 
loose equalit (==) check only value 
strict equalit (===) check value and type

obeject in js : obeject is real world entity that contain method and property 
ex : human , property age,  name, method : runing, reading, hearing 
const human={
    firstName : "shivam",
    lastName: "singh",
    age: 22,
    
    read: function(){
        console.log("human are read");
    }
};

with the help of (.) access the object method and property 
object creation 
factory function 

function createHuman(name, ag)
{
    return human={
        firstName : name -or- name,
        age: ag, -or- ag,
        
        read: function(){
            console.log("human are read");
        }
    };
}

let obj1=createHuman("shivam", 22);


constructor function follow pascal rule ->first letter of every word is capital 
function CreateHuman(name, age)
{
    this.name=name,
    this.age=age,
    
    this.read=function(){
        console.log("human are read book ");
    }
}

let obj2=new CreateHuman("shivam", age);
//add new property 
obj2.color="white";
console.log(obj2);

//delete property
delete obj2.color;
console.log(obj2);

undefined : indicates that a variable has been declared but not given a value, 
not defined : indicates that a variable does not exist.

let and const are hoisted but remain uninitialized until their declaration is reached, leading to a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a behavior in JavaScript that refers to the time between  point where the variable is declared and initialized.
During this time, any attempt to access the variable will result in a ReferenceError.

{
  console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
  let x = 5;
  console.log(x); // 5
}

{
  console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
  const y = 10;
  console.log(y); // 10
}

Why Does the Temporal Dead Zone Exist?
The TDZ helps enforce a safer coding practice by preventing the use of variables before they are explicitly declared and 
initialized. It reduces the chances of bugs caused by accessing undefined or unintended values.
